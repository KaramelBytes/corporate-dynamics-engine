## 🎯 What Was Built

**Complex AI-powered corporate simulation** that demonstrates enterprise architecture patterns through an interactive business adventure game. Players navigate corporate politics while the system models multi-dimensional stakeholder relationships with realistic cascade effects.

### ⚡ The Sophisticated Stuff

- **🧠 Multi-Provider AI Orchestration**: Intelligent routing between OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini with automatic fallbacks
- **💰 Smart Cost Optimization**: Semantic caching + context compression designed to achieve significant cost reduction
- **🔄 Enterprise Resilience**: Circuit breakers, health monitoring, and graceful degradation
- **📊 Real-time Analytics**: Comprehensive metrics, budget tracking, and performance monitoring
- **🎭 Complex Business Logic**: Multi-dimensional stakeholder relationships with influence networks and behavioral patterns
- **⚙️ State Management**: Complete audit trail with rollback capabilities for enterprise compliance

### 🎮 The Experience

Navigate corporate scenarios where your decisions create ripple effects through complex stakeholder networks. Watch relationships evolve, alliances form, and corporate cultures shift based on your choices. All powered by AI that generates contextually appropriate content while optimizing for cost and quality.
